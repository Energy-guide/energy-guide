- 'Bad' hour time frames often when I am not using much energy anyway, i.e. in the night

Messaging App (WhatsApp, signal, etc...)","- More background, explanation and information on the website what are the specific effects I am producing when following the recommendations and how the recommendations are made.

- More clever time frames, i.e. a recommendation to not use energy in time frames between 2 and 4 in the morning is generally not really helpful

- Give recommendations directly in email without having to go on website

- Give graphic to show the emissions over the day with recommended time frame highlighted so users not only get info on specific time frames but also for the whole day. For example, to check if it's better to use an appliance at this or that time even if the time is outside of recommendation hours

Impact of my action.","My personal schedule didn’t match up to the recommendation.

Sometimes a recommendation was for the night (2am) where I didn’t even have the recommendation yet.

Lastly, I don’t check my emails very often.",4,3,"A dedicated App","I love the concept! Execution needs to be better and be implemented into one’s lifestyle through an app that adds value like how much one really saves and maybe partner with an organisation to offer incentives. Something like, but not, like what health insurers offer when you get teeth cleaning or get fit then you get a cash back. In that vein, something like when you save x amount of energy by switching to renewables then you get 20€ cash back or whatever else is attractive."
